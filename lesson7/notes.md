# GC 7.1

To input a line of codes into computer with keyboard, I press a key.
If the line doesn't end, I press another key,
Until all charactors are pressed in turn.

# GC 7.2

For the myGCD function, does it matter if a > b or a < b?

No. When a < b, `a mod b = a` (for example, `mod 16 20 = 16`).
So in the next turn, `a` and `b` swap. 
For example, `myGCD 16 20 = myGCD 20 16`.
